# KiwiÂ³ v0.0.3pre-alpha (version system subject to change)

This game / engine is focused on being extremely expandable, having easy and powerful modding support, being ultra performant, and having official tools for creating content and mods that anyone can use and get the hang of.

Currently working on:

- Chunk handling system with world class for loading, unloading and rendering.
- Adding support for multiple block types, such as grass blocks and stone blocks, along with attributes for (future) gameplay.
- Gameplay elements such as items, physics, and mutability of the world.
